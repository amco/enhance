enhance is a simple image viewer with zooming and UIDynamics for maximum fun.

Its roots come from the very functional [URBMediaFocusViewController](https://github.com/u10int/URBMediaFocusViewController) pod but I'm in the process of ruthlessly hacking things apart, fixing bugs, slimming down the API and focusing its goals. Seemed better to start a new pod instead of inundating the original repo with unsolicited PRs.

## Requirements

* iOS 7 and up
* Super awesome images you want people to see enhanced
* A good attitude

## Installation

enhance is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "enhance"

Or try it out by doing this (don't worry, it goes to /tmp and disappears when you no longer have love in your heart to give to enhance)

    pod try enhance


## Contribution

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project and submit a pull request from a feature or bugfix branch.
* Please include tests. This is important so we don't break your changes unintentionally in a future version.
* Please don't modify the podspec, version, or changelog. If you do change these files, please isolate a separate commit so we can cherry-pick around it.
